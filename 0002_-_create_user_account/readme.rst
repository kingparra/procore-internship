Ticket 2. Create user account
*****************************
Procore Plus just hired a new system administrator who needs access to your
account. Please create a local user account for Riky Clemente and grant him
Power User privileges.

You can find a log of my work in worklog.rst.
There is also some code to set up the account under the ``terraform`` directory.
Sensitive information in IaC will always be store in Secrets Manager, and not in source code.
